# Probability Enhanced Entropy_acoustic_feature_extraction
This repository contains MatLab implementation for Probability Enhanced Entropy (PEE) acoustic feature extraction

# Implementation Steps
This feature has five (05) significant steps, 
1. The segmented audio sample taken as input and normalised between -1 to 1
2. Then quantised into different decision levels by dividing the amplitude range with the size of each interval
3. The number of occurrences in each level is counted
4. Probability is calculated for each level
5. Finally, based on the probability of each level, entropy is calculated

# Results 
Calculated PEE feature will be written to excel sheet 

# Contact Information
The model has been developed in Faculty of Integrated Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Jalan Tungku Link, BE 1410, Brunei
